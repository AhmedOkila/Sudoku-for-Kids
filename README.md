# JavaScript Sudoku for Kids

The project is a simplified version of normal sudoku, with two levels, level one being a 4x4 grid and level two being a more challenging 9x9 grid

## How to play?

You can start by installing the project and run the "index.html" file in the HTML folder


## Using localStorage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
